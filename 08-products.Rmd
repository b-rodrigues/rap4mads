What you’ll have learned by the end of the chapter: you'll know how to build data products using Quarto and Shiny.

## Introduction

We are going to start by building data products using Quarto.

Quarto is a tool created by Posit, the company behind RStudio and Shiny. Quarto leverages pandoc to
convert between many document formats (for example, from `.md` to `.docx`) and makes it possible to
embed R, Python, Julia and Observable JS code into documents. It is not an R-specific tool, so it is
a program that you must install on your computer. So go to this 
[link](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) and download and install Quarto.

We are going to start simple, with "static" data products. By static I mean products without any
sort of interactivity, so the user can look at them, read them, but not change them in any way.
These products are essentially going to be documents in the `.docx`, `.pptx` and `.pdf` formats,
but also `.html`. Thanks to Quarto, it is thus possible to programmatically create documents.


## A first taste of Quarto

A Quarto file looks very close to a standard Markdown file. So if you know Markdown, you will not have
many problems to switch to Quarto. If you don't know Markdown, no worries, its syntax is quite simple
and can be very quickly picked up.

Let's start with a basic Quarto source. Open your favorite text editor (doesn't have to be RStudio) and
create a file called `example.qmd` and copy the following lines in it:

````{verbatim}
---
title: "My Title"
author: "My name"
date: today
---

## This is a simple quarto document
```{r}
n <- 10
rnorm(n)
```
````

[This is the output](https://tiny-melomakarona-b87385.netlify.app/).

The first few lines of the document is where you can define the title of the document, the name of the author
and the date. For the date, I've use the `today` keyword to get today's date
but you could use a string to set the date to a specific day (for example, "2022-10-28").
The content in the document consists of a level 2 title (`## This is a simple quarto document`) and of an 
R code chunk. Code chunks is were you will write code that gets then evaluated at render (compile) time.
To compile this file, run the following inside a terminal:

```
➤ quarto render example.qmd
```

If you're inside RStudio, you can also render the document by pressing `CTRL-SHIFT-K` or run the command:

```{r, eval = F}
quarto::quarto_render("example.qmd")
```

There are various ways to integrate Quarto with different editors:

- [VS Code](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html)
- [RStudio](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)
- [Jupyter](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/jupyter.html)
- [(Neo)Vim, Emacs, Sublime](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/text-editor.html#editor-modes)

Once the file is done rendering, you should find an `html` file in the same folder. 
Open this html file inside a web browser and see the output. It is possible to run arbitrary R code
inside the code chunks:


````{verbatim}
---
title: "My Title"
author: "My name"
date: today
---

## This is a simple quarto document

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(myPackage)

data("unemp")

unemp %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(level == "Commune",
         place_name %in% c("Luxembourg", "Esch-sur-Alzette", "Wiltz")) %>% 
  group_by(place_name) %>%
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(plots = map2(.x = data, .y = place_name, ~ggplot(data = .x) +
                                                theme_minimal() +
                                                geom_line(aes(year, unemployment_rate_in_percent, group = 1)) +
                                                labs(title = paste("Unemployment in", .y)))) %>%
  pull(plots)
```
````

[This is what the output looks like.](https://scintillating-crostata-2df896.netlify.app/)

As you can see, it is quite easy to create a document with potentially hundreds of plots using what we've learned 
until now. However, our document does not look great; for starters, we see the source code there, which we would like to hide.
People that will read this document might not be interested in the source code, but only in the plots. The other issue
is that when loading the `{dplyr}` package, users get some message informing them about some functions that get masked.
We would like to hide all of this. It turns out that code chunks have options, and we can use them to hide source code
and warning messages:


````{verbatim}
---
title: "My Title"
author: "My name"
date: today
---

## This is a simple quarto document

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(myPackage)

data("unemp")

unemp %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(level == "Commune",
         place_name %in% c("Luxembourg", "Esch-sur-Alzette", "Wiltz")) %>%
  group_by(place_name) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(plots = map2(.x = data, .y = place_name, ~ggplot(data = .x) +
                                                theme_minimal() +
                                                geom_line(aes(year, unemployment_rate_in_percent, group = 1)) +
                                                labs(title = paste("Unemployment in", .y)))) %>%
  pull(plots)
```
````

[This is what the output looks like.](https://velvety-taffy-93cb66.netlify.app/)

Rendering this document will result in something nicer. We could also fold the code instead of completely removing
it. This is useful if we need to send the document to collaborators who might be interested in the source code as well.
However, code folding is something that only works in `html` outputs, and thus we need to specify the output format in the
header of the document (look at the three new lines after we define the data), and also remove the `echo: false` option
from the R chunk:

````{verbatim}
---
title: "My Title"
author: "My name"
date: today
format: 
  html:
    code-fold: true
---

## This is a simple quarto document

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(myPackage)

data("unemp")

unemp %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(level == "Commune",
         place_name %in% c("Luxembourg", "Esch-sur-Alzette", "Wiltz")) %>%
  group_by(place_name) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(plots = map2(.x = data, .y = place_name, ~ggplot(data = .x) +
                                                theme_minimal() +
                                                geom_line(aes(year, unemployment_rate_in_percent, group = 1)) +
                                                labs(title = paste("Unemployment in", .y)))) %>%
  pull(plots)
```
````

[This is what the output looks like.](https://voluble-choux-674399.netlify.app/)


It is of course possible to write several R chunks:

````{verbatim}
---
title: "My Title"
author: "My name"
date: today
format: 
  html:
    code-fold: true
---

## This is a simple quarto document

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(myPackage)

data("unemp")

unemp <- unemp %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(level == "Commune")
```

There are `r length(unique(unemp$place_name))` communes in the dataset.
Below we plot the unemployment rate for 3 communes:

```{r}
unemp %>%
  filter(place_name %in% c("Luxembourg", "Esch-sur-Alzette", "Wiltz")) %>%
  group_by(place_name) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(plots = map2(.x = data, .y = place_name, ~ggplot(data = .x) +
                                                theme_minimal() +
                                                geom_line(aes(year, unemployment_rate_in_percent, group = 1)) +
                                                labs(title = paste("Unemployment in", .y)))) %>%
  pull(plots)
```
````

[This is what the output looks like](https://relaxed-concha-89be95.netlify.app/).

### Python and Julia code chunks

It is possible, inside the same Quarto document, to define code chunks that run Python (or even Julia) code.
Put the following lines inside a file called `example2.qmd`
(to run the example below, you will need to have Python installed):

````{verbatim}
---
title: "R and Python"
author: "Bruno Rodrigues"
date: today
---

## This is a simple quarto document

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(myPackage)

data("unemp")

unemp <- unemp %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(level == "Commune")
```


```{python}
print("hello from Python")
import sys
print(sys.version)
```

````

[This is what the output looks like.](https://phenomenal-clafoutis-2b05c1.netlify.app/)

If you have trouble rendering this line, make sure that you have the `jupyter` and `jupyterlab` modules installed.

It is also possible to pass objects from R to Python (and vice-versa):

````{verbatim}
---
title: "R and Python"
author: "Bruno Rodrigues"
date: today
---

## This is a simple quarto document

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(myPackage)

data("unemp")

unemp <- unemp %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(level == "Commune")
```

The data that was loaded and cleaned from R can be accessed from Python using `r.unemp`:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
unemp_pd = pd.DataFrame(r.unemp)
unemp_pd.head
```

````

[This is what the output looks like.](https://endearing-gnome-80e9df.netlify.app/)

The HTML output is quite flexible, as it is possible to also integrate JS libraries. The following
example uses the `{g2r}` library (an R wrapper around the g2 javascript library) for creating
visualisations. To run the following code, make sure that you have the `{g2r}` package installed
(can only be install from github):

```{r, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("devOpifex/g2r")
```

The source file looks like this:

````{verbatim}
---
title: "Quarto and JS libraries"
author: "My name"
date: today
format: 
  html:
    code-fold: true
---

## This is a simple quarto document showing basic plot interactivity using {g2r}

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(g2r)
library(myPackage)

data("unemp")

unemp <- unemp %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(level == "Commune")
```

There are `r length(unique(unemp$place_name))` communes in the dataset. Below we plot the unemployment rate for 3 communes:

```{r}
unemp %>%
  filter(place_name %in% c("Luxembourg", "Esch-sur-Alzette", "Wiltz")) %>%
  g2(data = .) %>% 
  fig_line(asp(year, unemployment_rate_in_percent, color = place_name)) 
```

````

[This is what the output looks like.](https://timely-marzipan-6380f0.netlify.app/)

It is possible to use other JS libraries, like here `DataTables`, wrapped inside the `{DT}` package:

````{verbatim}
---
title: "Quarto and JS libraries"
author: "My name"
date: today
format: 
  html:
    toc: true
    code-fold: true
---

## Basic plot interactivity using {g2r}

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(g2r)
library(DT)
library(myPackage)

data("unemp")

unemp <- unemp %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year)) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(level == "Commune")
```

There are `r length(unique(unemp$place_name))` communes in the dataset. Below we plot the unemployment rate for 3 communes:

```{r}
unemp %>%
  filter(place_name %in% c("Luxembourg", "Esch-sur-Alzette", "Wiltz")) %>%
  g2(data = .) %>% 
  fig_line(asp(year, unemployment_rate_in_percent, color = place_name)) 
```

## Interactive tables with {DT}

```{r}
unemp %>%
  DT::datatable(filter = "top") 
```

## Others

The final example illustrates templating. It is possible to write code that generates qmd code:

````{verbatim}
---
title: "Templating with Quarto"
author: "Bruno Rodrigues"
date: today
format: 
  html:
    toc: true
---


# Set up
The goal is to have a frequency table for each question in a survey. But we
do not want to have to do it by hand, so we define a function to create a 
table, and then, using the templating capabilities of Quarto, write some
code to generate valid qmarkdown code. In the example below our survey only
has 4 questions, but the solution described trivially scales to an infinity
of questions. This is not the case if you’re solving this problem by hand.

Start by loading the data and defining some needed variables:

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(rlang)
library(DT)
survey_data <- read.csv(
"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/b-rodrigues/0c2249dec5a9c9477e0d1ad9964a1340/raw/873bcc7532b8bad613235f029884df1d0b947c90/survey_example.csv"
)


```

Let’s take a look at the data:

```{r}
datatable(survey_data)
```

The column names are actually questions, so we save those in a variable:

```{r}
questions <- colnames(survey_data)

questions
```

Now we define question codes:

```{r}
codes <- paste0("var_", seq(1, 4))

codes
```

We create a lookup table that links questions to their codes:

```{r}
lookup <- bind_cols("codes" = codes, "questions" = questions)

datatable(lookup)
```

Finally, we replace the question names in the dataset by the code:

```{r}
colnames(survey_data) <- codes

datatable(survey_data)
```

Now, we define a function that creates a frequency table. This function has
two arguments: `dataset` and `var`. It uses the `dplyr::count()` function to
count each instance of the levels of `var` in `dataset`. Then it uses the 
`knitr::kable()` function. This functions takes a data frame as an argument
and returns a table formatted in markdown code:

```{r}
create_table <- function(dataset, var){
  dataset %>%
    count(!!var) %>%
    knitr::kable()
}
```

The next function is the one that does the magic: it takes only one argument
as an input, and generates valid markdown code using the `knitr::knit_expand()`
function. Any variable between `{{}}` gets replaced by its value (so 
`{{question}}` gets replaced by the question that gets fetched from the 
lookup table defined above). Using this function, we can now loop over 
question codes, and what we get in return is valid markdown code that defines
a section with the question as the title, and our table.

```{r}
return_section <- function(var){
  a <- knitr::knit_expand(text = c("## {{question}}",   create_table(survey_data, var)),
                          question = lookup$questions[grepl(quo_name(var), lookup$codes)])
  cat(a, sep = "\n")
}
```

Our codes are strings, so to be able to use them inside of `dplyr::count()`
we need to define them as bare string, or symbols. This can be done using the
`rlang::sym()` function. If this is confusing, try running `count(mtcars, "am")` 
and you will see that it will not return what you want (compare to `count(mtcars, am)`). 
This is also why we needed `rlang::quo_name()` in the function above, to convert
the symbol back to a string, which is what `grepl()` requires:

```{r}
sym_codes <- map(codes, sym)
```

Finally, we can create the sections. The line below uses `purrr::walk()`, which
is equivalent to `purrr::map()`, the difference being that we use `purrr::walk()`
when we are interested in the side effects of a function:

```{r, results="asis"}
walk(sym_codes, return_section)
```


````


[This is what the output looks like.](https://startling-shortbread-bc36ea.netlify.app/).


## Other output formats

### Word

Let’s now generate a Word document using Quarto. As you will see, this will be quite easy; but keep in mind that the basic
interactivity that we have seen with HTML outputs won’t be possible here (but templating will work). Render the following
source file to get back a `.docx` document (you don’t even need to have MS Word installed for it to work), and 
take of what we changed from the previous file:

- Output changed from `html` to `docx`;
- No more `{DT}`, but `{pander}` instead to generated `.docx` tables

Here is the file:

```{r}
pander(head(survey_data))
```

The column names are actually questions, so we save those in a variable:

```{r}

Unlike with HTML outputs, it is also not possible to enable code folding, but you could hide the code completely using the "#| echo = false" 
chunk option. If you wan to hide all the code without having to specify "#| echo = false" on each chunk you can also add the `execute` option
to the document header:

````{verbatim}
---

author: "Bruno Rodrigues"

format: docx
execute:
  echo: false
---
````

You can use a document as a template for Word documents generated with Quarto. For this, you must create a new Word file, and update the
styles. This document, with the updated styles, can then be referenced in the header to act as a template:

````{verbatim}
---
title: "Using a custom Word style"
author: "Bruno Rodrigues"
date: today
format: 
  docx: 
    reference-doc: fancy_template.docx
execute:
  echo: false
---

# Introduction

## MS Word is great (lol)

This is normal text that is unreadable.

````

Just put `fancy_template.docx` in the same folder as your source qmd file. You can download the template I’ve used from 
[here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rap4mads/blob/master/img/fancy_template.docx?raw=true) to test things out.

For more details, visit this [page](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word-templates.html).

### Presentations

It is also possible to create presentations using Quarto. There are output formats as well: HTML, PDF and Powerpoint. I will
not discuss this here, because it is quite easy to get started, simply [follow along](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/).

### PDF

I do need to discuss the PDF output a little bit. In order to generate PDF files, Quarto uses the `pdflatex` compiler (or rather
pandoc, called by Quarto, uses `pdflatex`). `pdflatex` compiles `.tex` source files to PDF, so what Quarto does (by leveraging pandoc)
is first converting a `.qmd` file to a `.tex` file, and then call `pdflatex` to compile it. `.tex` files are the file extension of the
Latex typesetting language, extensively used in science. It makes it easy to write complex mathematical formulas, like this one:

\begin{align*}
S(\omega) 
&= \frac{\alpha g^2}{\omega^5} e^{[ -0.74\bigl\{\frac{\omega U_\omega 19.5}{g}\bigr\}^{\!-4}\,]} \\
&= \frac{\alpha g^2}{\omega^5} \exp\Bigl[ -0.74\Bigl\{\frac{\omega U_\omega 19.5}{g}\Bigr\}^{\!-4}\,\Bigr] 
\end{align*}

Latex is a bit unwieldly, so using Markdown to write scientific documents is becoming more and more popular. However, Latex still 
has an edge when it comes to tables. But thankfully, it is possible to simply embed the Latex code that produces these tables in Markdown,
and there are packages that export regression table directly to PDF. In any case, in order to compile to PDF, you need to install 
Texlive. Installing Texlive is frankly a mess, but thankfully there is a very simple alternative called TinyTex. TinyTex is both
available as an R package or as a standalone installation, and was put together by the author of RMarkdown (in a sense, Quarto is
a spiritual successor to RMarkdown). This package installs a self-contained Texlive installation locally, which can then be used 
to compile PDF documents (from, or outside of R/RStudio). I highly recommend you use Tinytex. Instructions can be found
[here](https://yihui.org/tinytex/). Once you’ve installed TinyTex, you can try to compile the following example document 
(the first time you run this, it might take some time, as the required packages get installed):

````{verbatim}

title: "PDF example with table"
format: pdf

## A PDF document using Quarto

In the code below, we fit several models and then use the `{modelsummary}`
package to print a nicely formatted table with minimal effort:

```{r}
library(modelsummary)

url <- 'https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/HistData/Guerry.csv'
dat <- read.csv(url)

models <- list(
  "OLS 1"     = lm(Donations ~ Literacy + Clergy, data = dat),
  "Poisson 1" = glm(Donations ~ Literacy + Commerce, family = poisson, data = dat),

And an equation, for good measure:

\begin{align*}
S(\omega) 
&= \frac{\alpha g^2}{\omega^5} e^{[ -0.74\bigl\{\frac{\omega U_\omega 19.5}{g}\bigr\}^{\!-4}\,]} \\
&= \frac{\alpha g^2}{\omega^5} \exp\Bigl[ -0.74\Bigl\{\frac{\omega U_\omega 19.5}{g}\Bigr\}^{\!-4}\,\Bigr] 
\end{align*}

It is possible to author, many, many, different types of documents using Quarto. For more formats, consult this 
[page](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/). Quarto is still very new -- it was officially anounced in July of 2022 by Posit-- so
much more content will arrive. There are still many features of Quarto that we have not explored, so take your time to read
its documentation in detail.

## Interactive web applications with {shiny}

`{shiny}` is a package developed by Posit to build interactive web applications. These apps can be quite "simple" 
(for example, an app that shows a graph but in which the user can choose the variable to plot), but can be arbitrarily
complex. Some people even go as far as make [games with {shiny}](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/hex-memory.html).
[A version for Python](https://shiny.rstudio.com/py/) is also in alpha, and you can already experiment with it.

In this section, I will give a very, very short introduction to `{shiny}`. This is because `{shiny}` is so feature-rich,
that I could spend 20 hours teaching you and even then we would not have seen everything. That being said, we can with
only some cursory knowledge build some useful apps. These apps can run locally on your machine, but they're really only
useful if deploy them on a server, so that users can then use these web apps on their browsers.

### The basic structure of a Shiny app

Shiny apps are always made of at least 2 parts: a *server* and a *ui*. In general, each of these parts are in separate
scripts called `server.R` and `ui.R`. It is possible to have another script, called `global.R`, where you can define
variables that you want to be available for both the server and the ui, and to every user of your app.

Let's start by building a very basic app. This app will allow users to visualize unemployment data for Luxembourg. 
For now, let's say that we want users only to be able to select communes, but not variables. The example code
below is based on this [official example](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/telephones-by-region.html) 
(this is how I recommend you learn by the way. Take a look at the different example there are and adapt them 
to suit your needs! You can find the examples [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/#demos)). 
Create a folder called something like `my_app` and then create three scripts in it:

- `global.R`
- `server.R`
- `ui.R`

Let's start with `global.R`:

```{r, eval = F}
library(myPackage)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

data("unemp")
```

In the `global.R` file, we load the required packages and data. This is now available everywhere. Let's 
continue with the `server.R` script:

```{r, eval = F}
server <- function(session, input, output) {

  filtered_data <- reactive(
    unemp %>%
    filter(place_name %in% input$place_name_selected)
  )

  output$unemp_plot <- renderPlot({

    ggplot(data = filtered_data()) +
      theme_minimal() +
      geom_line(aes(year, unemployment_rate_in_percent, color = place_name)) +
      labs(title = paste("Unemployment in", paste(input$place_name_selected, collapse = ", ")))


  })
}
```

Several things need to be commented here: first, the script contains a single function, called
`server()`. This function take three arguments, `session`, `input` and `output`. I won't go into
details here, but you should know that you will never call the `server()` function yourself, and
that these arguments are required so the function can... function. I will leave a reference at the
end of this section with more details. The next important thing is that we defined an object called
`filtered_data`. This is a reactive object. What this means is that this object should get
recomputed every time the user interacts with it. But how does the user interact with it? By
choosing the `place_name` he or she wants to see! The predicate inside `filter()` is `place_name
%in% input$place_name_selected`. Where does that `input$place_name_selected` come from? This comes
from the `ui` (that we have not written yet). But the idea is that the user will be able to chose
place names from a list, and this list will be called `place_name_selected` and will contain the
place names that the user wants to see.

Finally, we define a new object called `output$unemp_plot`. The goal of the `server()` function is
to compute things that will be part of the `output` list. This list, and the objects it contains, 
get then rendered in the `ui`. `unemp_plot` is a ggplot graph that uses the reactive data set
we defined first. Notice the `()` after `filtered_data` inside the ggplot call. These are required; 
this is how we say that the reactive object must be recomputed. If the plot does not get rendered,
the reactive data set does not get computed, since it never gets called.

Ok so now to the ui. Let's take inspiration from the same example again:

```{r, eval = F}
ui <- function(request){
  fluidPage(

    titlePanel("Unemployment in Luxembourg"),

    sidebarLayout(

      sidebarPanel(
        selectizeInput("place_name_selected", "Select place:",
                    choices=unique(unemp$place_name),
                    multiple = TRUE,
                    selected = c("Rumelange", "Dudelange"),
                    options = list(
                      plugins = list("remove_button"),
                      create = TRUE,
                      persist = FALSE # keep created choices in dropdown
                    )
                    ),
        hr(),
        helpText("Original data from STATEC")
      ),

      mainPanel(
        plotOutput("unemp_plot")
      )
    )
  )

}
```

I've added some useful things to the ui. First of all, I made it a function of an argument,
`request`. This is useful for bookmarking the state of the variable. We'll add a bookmark button
later. The ui is divided into two parts, a sidebar panel, and a main panel. The sidebar panel is
where you will typically add dropdown menus, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc, for the users to make
various selections. In the main panel, you will show the result of their selections. In the sidebar
panel I add a `selectizeInput()` to create a dynamic dropdown list using the `selectize` JS
library, included with `{shiny}`. The available choices are all the unique place names contained in
our data, I allow users to select multiple place names, by default two communes are selected and
using the `options` argument I need little "remove" buttons in the selected commune names. Finally,
in the main panel I use the `plotOutput()` function to render the plot. Notice that I use the name
of the plot defined in the server, "unemp_plot". Finally, to run this, add a new script, called 
`app.R` and add the following line in it:

```{r, eval = F}
shiny::runApp(".")
```

You can now run this script in RStudio, or from any R console, and this should open a web browser
with your app.

<div style="text-align:center;">
<video width="640" height="480" controls>
  <source src="img/shiny_1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</div>

Believe it or not, but this app contains almost every ingredient you need to know to build shiny apps.
But of course, there are many, many other widgets that you can use to give your users even more
ways to interact with applications. I will give you another example, and then we will need to move on.

### Slightly more advanced shiny

- users can choose which variable they want to see
- users can choose position of legend
- switching from line plot to polygon plot
- action button to plot
- bookmark button
- replace ggplot with g2r
