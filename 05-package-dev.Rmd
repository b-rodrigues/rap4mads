# A package for a project

## Introduction

In this chapter we're going to develop a package that will contain a couple of functions.
Don't focus too much on what these functions do or don't do, that's not really important.
What matters is that you understand how to build your own package, and why that's useful.

Actually, we can start by why that's useful right now.

R, as you know, has many many packages. When you type something like 

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("dplyr")
```

This install the `{dplyr}` package. The package gets downloaded from a repository called 
CRAN - The Comprehensive R Archive Network (or from one of its mirrors). Developers thus
work on their packages and once they feel the package is ready for productions they submit
it to CRAN. There are very strict rules to respect to publish on CRAN; but if the developers
respects these rules, and the package does something *non-trivial* (that's not really defined
but the idea is that your package cannot simply be a collection of your implementation
of common mathematical functions for example), it'll get published. 

CRAN is actually quite a miracle; it works really well, and it's been working well for years,
even decades, as CRAN was founded in [1997](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/1997/000001.html).
Installing packages on R is rarely frustrating, and when it is, it is rarely, if not never,
CRAN's fault (there are some packages that require your operating system to have certain
libraries or programs installed beforehand, and these can be frustrating to install, like `java`
or certain libraries used for geospatial statistics).

But while from the point of view from the user, CRAN is great, there are sometimes some
frictions between package developers and CRAN maintainers. I'll spare you the drama, but just
know that contributing to CRAN can be sometimes frustrating.

This does not concern us however, because we are going to learn how to develop a package but
we are not going to publish it to CRAN. Instead, we will be using github.com as a replacement
for CRAN. This has the advantage that we do not have to be so strict and disciplined when 
writing our package, and other users can install the package almost just as easily from
github.com, with the following command:

```{r, eval = F}
remotes::install_github("github_username/some_package")
```

It is also possible to build the package and send it as a file per email for example, and then
install a local copy. This is more cumbersome, that's why we're going to use github.com as a
repository.

## Getting started

Let's first start by opening RStudio, and starting a new project:

<video width="640" height="480" controls>
  <source src="img/new_package.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Following these steps creates a folder in the specified path that already contains
some scaffolding for our package. This also opens a new RStudio session with the
default script `hello.R` opened:

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pack_1.png")
```

We can remove this script, but do take note of the following sentence:

```
# You can learn more about package authoring with RStudio at:
#
#   http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/
#
```

If this course succeeded in turning you into an avid R programmer, you might want to contribute
to the language by submitting some nice packages. You could at that point refer to this link
to learn the many, many subtleties of package development. But for our purposes, this chapter
will suffice. 

Ok, so now let's take a look inside the folder you just created and take a look at the package's 
structure. You can do so easily from within RStudio:

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pack_2.png")
```

But you can also navigate to the folder from inside a file explorer. The folder that will 
matter to us the most for now is the `R` folder. This folder will contain your scripts, which
will contain your package's functions. Let's start by adding a new script.

## Adding functions

To add a new script, simply create a new script, and while we're at it, let's add some code to it:

<video width="640" height="480" controls>
  <source src="img/pack_adding_script.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

and that's it! Well, this example is incredibly easy; there will be more subtleties later on,
but these are the basics: simply write your script as usual. Now let's load the package with 
`CTRL-SHIFT-L`. Loading the package makes it available in your current R session:

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pack_3.png")
```

As you can see, the package is loaded, and RStudio's autocomplete even suggest the function's name
already. So now that we have already a function, let's push our code to github.com (you remember that
we checked the box `Create a git repository` when we started the project?). For this, 
let's go back to github.com and create a new repository. Give it the same name as your package 
on your computer, just to avoid confusion. Once the repo is created, you will see this familiar
screen:

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pack_4.png")
```

We will start from an existing repository, because our repository already exists. So we can 
use the terminal to enter the commands suggested here. We can also use the terminal
from RStudio:

<video width="640" height="480" controls>
  <source src="img/adding_remote.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>


The steps above are a way to link your local repository to the remote repository living
on github.com. Without these initial steps, there is no way to link your package project
to github.com!

Let's now write another function, which will depend on functions from other packages.

### Functions dependencies

In the same script, add the following code:

```{r, eval = F}
only_automatics <- function(dataset){
  dataset |>
    filter(am == 1)
}

```

This creates a function that takes a dataset as an argument, and filters the `am` variable.
This function is not great: it is not documented, so the user might not know that the dataset
that is meant here is the `mtcars` dataset (which is included with R by default). So we will
need to document this. Also, the variable `am` is hardcoded, that's not good either. What if 
the user wants to filter another variable with another value? We will solve these issues later
on. But there is a worse problem here. The `filter()` function that the developer intended to
use here is `dplyr::filter()`, so the one from the `{dplyr}` package. However, there are several
functions called `filter()`. If you start typing `filter` inside a fresh R session, here is 
what the autocomplete suggests to you:

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pack_5.png")
```

So there's a `filter()` function from the `{stats}` package (which gets loaded automatically 
with every new R session), and there's a capital F `Filter()` function from the `{base}` 
package (R is case sensitive, so `filter()` and `Filter()` are different functions).
So how can the developer specify the correct `filter()` function? Simply by using the following
notation: `dplyr::filter()` (which we have already encountered). So let's rewrite the function 
correctly:

```{r, eval = F}
only_automatics <- function(dataset){
  dataset |>
    dplyr::filter(am == 1)
}

```

Great, so now `only_automatics()` at least knows which `filter ` function to use, but this function
could be improved a lot more. In general, what you want is to have a function that is general enough
that it could work with any variable (if the dataset is supposed to be fixed), or that could work
with any combination of dataset and variable. Let's make our function a bit more general,
by making it work on any variable from any dataset

```{r, eval = F}
my_filter <- function(dataset, condition){
  dataset |>
    dplyr::filter(condition)
}

```

I renamed the function to `my_filter()` because now this function can work on any dataset and
with any predicate condition (of course this function is not really useful, since it's only a 
wrapper around `filter()`. But that's not important). Let's save the script and reload the
package with `CRTL-SHIFT-L` and try out the function:

```{r, eval = F}
my_filter(mtcars, am == 1)

```

You will get this output:

```
Error in `dplyr::filter()` at myPackage/R/functions.R:6:4:
! Problem while computing `..1 = condition`.
Caused by error in `mask$eval_all_filter()`:
! object 'am' not found
Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.
```

so what's going on? R complains that it cannot find `am`.
What is wrong with our function? After all, if I call the following, it works:

```{r}
mtcars |>
  filter(am == 1)
```

So what gives? What's going on here, is that R doesn't know that it has look
for `am` inside the `mtcars` dataset. R is looking for a variable called `am`
in the global environment, which does not exist. `dplyr::filter()` is programmed
in a way that tells R to look for `am` inside `mtcars` and not in the global
environment (or whatever parent environment the function gets called from).
We need to program our function in the same way. To do this, simply enclose 
references to columns of dataframes inside `{{}}`, like so:

```{r}
my_filter <- function(dataset, condition){
  dataset |>
    dplyr::filter({{condition}})
}

```

Now, R knows where to look. So reload the package with `CTRL-SHIFT-L` and 
try again:

```{r}
my_filter(mtcars, am == 1)
```

`{{}}` is not a feature available in a base installation of R, but is provided
by packages from the `tidyverse` (like `{dplyr}`, `{tidyr}`, etc). If you write functions
that depend on `{dplyr}` functions like `filter()`, `select()` etc, you'll have to know
keep using `{{}}`.

Let's now write a more useful function. Remember the datasets about unemployment in Luxembourg?
I'm thinking about the ones [here](https://rap4mads.eu/introduction-to-r.html#reading-in-data-with-r),
`unemp_2013.csv`, `unemp_2014.csv`, etc.
