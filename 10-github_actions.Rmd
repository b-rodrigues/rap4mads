We are almost at the end; actually, we could have stopped at the end of the previous chapter. We
have reached our goal; we are able to run pipeline in a 100% reproducible way. However, this
requires some manual steps. And maybe that's not a problem; if your image is done, and users only
need to pull it and run the container, that's not really a big problem. But you should keep in mind
that manual steps don't scale. Let's imagine another context; let's suppose that you are part of a
company and that you are part of a team that needs to quickly ship products to clients. Maybe
several people contribute to the product using, an internal version control solution (like a Gitlab
instance that is deployed on the premises of your company). Maybe you even need to work on several
products in the same day; you (and your teammates) should only be focusing writing code (and
`Dockerfiles`)... your time and resources cannot get clogged by building images (which depending on
what you're working on, can take quite some time). So ideally, we would want to offload these step.
That is what we are going to learn it.

Consider this chapter a very basic intro to CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous
Deployment/Delivery) and DevOps. In fact, to be more precise, we should be talking about GitOps.
