# Reproducible Analytical Pipelines - Master's of Data Science

This repository contains the files of the bookdown I use to teach "Reproducible Analytical Pipelines" in the master’s of data science at the University of Luxembourg.

You can find the bookdown [here](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/rap4mads/index.html). 

I make a lot of references to my other bookdown, [Modern R with the tidyverse](https://modern-rstats.eu/).

I think you can benefit from reading this bookdown even if you’re not a student of the master’s of data science. I go through the basics of what you need
to know in order to set up a RAP -- a reproducible analytical pipeline.

For any questions, just open an issue on this repository.
